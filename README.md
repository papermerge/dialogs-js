# Dialogs Js

Dialogs JS is the npm package for displaying various modals (rename, new folder, permissions).
Dialogs JS relies on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for modals templating.

The sole responsablity of any dialog is to collect user input and notify interested
parties (via events) about submited data.
